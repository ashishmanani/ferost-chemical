            At Dow, protecting people and the environment will be a part of everything we do and every decision we make. Each employee has a responsibility in ensuring that our products and operations meet applicable government or Dow standards, whichever is more stringent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal is to eliminate all injuries, prevent adverse environmental and health impacts, reduce waste and emissions and promote resource conservation at every stage of the life cycle of our products.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our EH&S Policy applies to all facilities and operations. All employees and contractors whose work and/or workplace is controlled by Dow are required to comply with Dow’s health and safety management system requirements in alignment with this policy. All employees and contractors receive EH&S training based on job role, job location, knowledge/skill performance and regulatory requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Safety and health are integral conversations with workers at all levels of the organization. Workers are expected and encouraged to identify, report and intervene without fear of reprisal when unsafe or unhealthy work conditions are observed. Worker input on hazards and solutions is part of local near-miss programs. Dow also collects and responds to feedback as part of safety meeting and training processes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Dow is committed to compliance with legal requirements, Dow standards and requirements, and contractual agreements in all regions where it operates. In cases where local or national laws, codes or regulations impose additional requirements beyond Dow standards for safe operations, affected facilities comply with those requirements or Dow requirements, whichever is more stringent. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Dow sites maintain dialogue with community stakeholders about emergency response plans, reduction of waste and emissions, and we create opportunities to educate and improve community confidence and address community needs.
        </p>
        <p>
        
          
            The Environment, Health, Safety & Technology Committee of the Dow Board of Directors has oversight responsibilities with respect to EH&S and annual review of the EH&S Policy. The Committee assesses current aspects of the Company’s policies and performance and makes recommendations to the Board and the management of the Company with regard to promoting and maintaining superior standards of performance, including processes to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
